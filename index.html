                <p class="info-line-height">
                    Bryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela
                    Cox Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef
                    of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname
                    "Jellybean." Bryant's family was Catholic and he had always practiced his faith. <br><br>
                    Bryant started playing basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When
                    Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional
                    basketball. After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became
                    accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he
                    considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. Bryant began to play basketball
                    seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study.
                    Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. He
                    also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the
                    United States to play in a basketball summer league. When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia,
                    where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

                <p class="b-header">Professional Career</p>
                <p class="b-semi-header">1996 NBA Draft</p>
                <p class="info-line-height">
                    Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry
                    Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, "marched over these people". <br><br>
                    The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to free up salary cap
                    space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the
                    time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade
                    agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select
                    minutes before the pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the
                    trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30,
                    Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium
                    ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able
                    to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5
                    million.
                </p>
                <p class="b-semi-header">Three-peat (1999-2002)</p>
                <p class="info-line-height">
                    Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred
                    during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards. When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had
                    an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per
                    game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games,
                    tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA
                    Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to receive All-Defensive
                    honors). While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances, including a
                    25-point, 11-rebound, 7-assist, 4-block game in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail
                    Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals, against the
                    Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot.
                    Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed
                    Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an OT victory as
                    O'Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120–118. With a 116–111 Game 6
                    victory, the Lakers won their first championship since 1988.<br><br>
                    Statistically, the 2000–01 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged six more points per
                    game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal began to surface. Once again, Bryant led
                    the team in assists, with five per game. The Lakers, however, only won 56 games, an 11-game dropoff from the previous
                    year. The Lakers would respond by going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first
                    round. In the semifinals round, the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48
                    points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119–113 series-clinching win. They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference
                    Finals to advance to the Finals, before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would
                    go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the
                    playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game.
                    In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league. Bryant ended up making the All-NBA
                    Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA
                    All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).<br><br>
                    In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a
                    then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 win over the visiting Memphis
                    Grizzlies. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also
                    had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after
                    a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from
                    his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were "going to cut your hearts out". While
                    making the All-NBA Defensive Team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his
                    career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento
                    Kings. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers' March 1,
                    2002 victory over the Pacers.<br><br>
                    The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While the
                    Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Lakers did not have
                    home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had
                    happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division
                    rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals, against the New Jersey Nets, Bryant
                    averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team's
                    points. At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships. Bryant's play was notable and praised
                    for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs. This cemented
                    Bryant's reputation as a "clutch player".
                </p>
                <p class="b-semi-header">Chasing a sixth championship</p>
                <p class="info-line-height">
                    Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total. The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first
                    eight games. In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in
                    NBA history to reach 26,000 career points. Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009. On
                    January 30 against the Celtics, he became the youngest player to score 27,000 points. On February 1, 2011, Bryant became
                    one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. In Boston on February 10, Bryant
                    scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92–86 win over
                    the Celtics. It was the Lakers' first victory of the season against one of the league's top four teams, as they entered
                    the game 0–5 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points. Bryant, selected to his 13th
                    straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011
                    All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards. During
                    the season, Bryant moved from 12th to 6th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek,
                    Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone. Bryant finished the season averaging
                    less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003–04 season.
                </p>
                <p class="b-semi-header">Final Season</p>
                <p class="info-line-height">
                    On November 29, 2015, Bryant announced via The Players' Tribune that he would be retiring at the end of the season. In
                    his poem titled "Dear Basketball", Bryant wrote that he fell in love with the game at age six: "A love so deep I gave
                    you my all/From my mind & body/To my spirit & soul." The 2015–16 season "is all I have left to give./My heart can take
                    the pounding/My mind can handle the grind/But my body knows it's time to say goodbye./And that's OK./I'm ready to let
                    you go." In a letter distributed to Lakers' fans before that evening's game against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant wrote,
                    "What you've done for me is far greater than anything I've done for you. ... My love for this city, this team and for
                    each of you will never fade. Thank you for this incredible journey."
